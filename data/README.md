### Data Downloads
Due to the size limit, the data are uploaded to our Dropbox, and it can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/txb6i8ewqycmx2g/AABCmHN-tbMrp35P90GWAv1oa?dl=0).

After downloading the `toy` directory, please extract `toy/CFC-5R.tar`:
```bash
  tar xvf toy/CFC-5R.tar
```

If everything is successfully downloaded and extracted, the current `data` directory structure should look as follows:

```bash
.
└── data
    ├── README.md
    └── toy
        └── CFC-5R
```
